This is the beginnings of my thesis...

This section will contain the overview to my working drafts for my PhD and publications. I would normally keep these files on dropbox  or something similar(and some still are). During this PhD I have been creating a reproducible workflow for my scientific career using version control. I am now in the process of slowly transferring projects version control using GIT and GIThub. Once I publish results and copyright is released I will publish the final documents on the Open Science Framework (OSF) or other scientific `repo/server`.

# Overview

The overarching aim of this PhD is to examine the role of predation, competition and resource flow in regulating invasive mammal populations in NZ forests. This research can then be used support other forecasting models to estimate the likely effects of species removals on the objectives set by the government of New Zealand under â€œPredator Free New Zealand 2050.

To do this I will construct ecological models that describe the population dynamics of interacting invasive species in New Zealand forests. I will use the understanding derived from these models to predict the effects of management manipulations and reduce the likelihood of unanticipated outcomes. Aligning this ecological research with good research practice that insures the results are reproducible and replicate by allowing open access to statistical code and analysis.

# Tools

I will compile my thesis using `bookdown`. Here is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
